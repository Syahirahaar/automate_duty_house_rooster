# automate_duty_house_rooster
This is a python script to assign name for weekly duty rooster for cleaning the house

Problem Statement
I need to manually assign the name and manually calculate the date for the duty rooster. I feel its wasting time, thus I come out with this idea

Improvement section
1. The code can be ask for how many week input you want, thus you dont have to repeat the same name during input for housemate name 
2. Make the input name dissappear
